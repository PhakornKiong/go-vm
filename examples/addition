// This example demonstrates a simple addition operation where multiple values are pushed onto the stack,
// added together sequentially, and the final result is stored and then returned from memory.
// Initially, 5 and 2 are pushed onto the stack and added to get 7.
// Then, 10 is pushed onto the stack and added to the previous result (7) to get 17.
// This final result (17) is then stored in memory and returned.

// Push the decimal value 5 onto the stack
PUSH1 0x05  
// Push the decimal value 2 onto the stack
PUSH1 0x02  
// Add the top two values on the stack
ADD         
// Push the decimal value 10 onto the stack
PUSH1 0x0A  
// Add the result of previous addition with 10
ADD         
// Store 8 byte result into memory at offset position 0
PUSH1 0x00
STORE8
// Return the 8 byte value from memory
PUSH1 0x08
PUSH1 0x00
RETURN
